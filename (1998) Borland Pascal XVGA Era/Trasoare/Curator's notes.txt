Description
-----------

A Tron/Lightcycle clone. Drive around the grid, taking care not to hit you or
your opponents' trails, and trying to get them to run into theirs.

Note that the game was intentionally made to look and sound very 'retro', as if
running on an arcade machine of old.

Technical Notes
---------------

There's some pretty nice direct handling of the PC speaker. The sound effects
really do seem to capture that Atari 2600 feel.
