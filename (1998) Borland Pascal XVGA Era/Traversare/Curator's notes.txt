Timeline
--------

Dates suggest a development period from 18 to 28 Jun 2000.

Description
-----------

A Frogger clone. Cross the lanes without getting hit by the myriad enemies.

Note that the game was intentionally made to look and sound very 'retro', as if
running on an arcade machine of old.

Technical Notes
---------------

There's some pretty nice direct handling of the PC speaker. The sound effects
really do seem to capture that Atari 2600 feel.

You wouldn't know it just from looking at it, but the enemy design pays homage
to a ZX Spectrum type-in that first introduced me to the Frogger concept.
