General Notes About the Borland Pascal XVGA Era
===============================================

As I started to become more familiar with Borland Pascal and move away from
QBasic, it was only natural that I would eagerly want to start writing games in
this new, much more powerful environment. Indeed, most of my programs made
during this time are games, save for the occasional utility such as the sprite
editor SprEdit (though this is also an effort related to the games).

A characteristic that distinguishes programs of this era from the BP BGI Era is
the use of assembly language routines for graphics, sound and other operations,
as opposed to using the standard, but slow and limited, facilities provided by
Borland Pascal. Often, the video mode used is 320x200x256 colors, as that was
the easiest to program for and often sufficient for my purposes.

As is typical for younger programmers, my ambitions greatly exceeded my
programming abilities and my understanding of the machine. I could code the
core mechanisms of a game or utility, but was not capable of writing graphics,
sound, keyboard and mouse routines from scratch. Fortunately, I had plenty of
help in the form of numerous freeware libraries, as well as the nice tutorials
in the PCGPE (PC Games Programmer's Encyclopedia). Thus, I take no credit for
most of the low-level code involving graphics, sound, keboard and mouse support,
though I did occasionally tweak it whenever I had a glimmer of understanding
as to what it was doing.

One other important note concerns the sound effects used in some of my games.
I have always strived for as much originality as possible in my games, and I
think I have often achieved this better than is typical for programmers of my
age. All of the graphics were always drawn painstakingly by me. Though the
fundamental game idea often drew inspiration from classics (Invaders, Star Trek
games etc.), the actual game mechanics were also entirely my creation. Some
games even feature music, also composed by me (which is obvious given how bad
it is). However, sound effects was where I drew the line. Creating original
sound effects is a task that is far beyond most adults, let alone a 13-year old.
As a result, my only option was to 'borrow' sounds from various other games
popular at that time. This in itself was not much of a problem, as the games
were really only intended for my personal use anyway, and I would have never
thought of publishing them as they were definitely not commercial quality stuff.
Things may be different now, however, given that, in making my 'museum' public,
I am publishing this problematic content as well. I suppose I might have to take
them down if there are objections, but I would hope that any such objector would
first consider the broader context of things and realize that I'm doing this for
the historical aspect alone. I could have replaced the sounds with free variants
post facto, but I want the games to appear exactly as I would have seen and
heard them at that time.
