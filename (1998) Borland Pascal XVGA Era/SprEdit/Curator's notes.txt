SprEdit
=======

Timeline
--------

A look at the file dates (see Appendix) suggests development started around
September 1998 and the last major edit was made in Apr 1999.

Description
-----------

SprEdit is the worthy successor to my homebrew sprite editor 'Graphics'. It
features a much friendlier interface, better drawing tools, a bigger canvas
(32x32 as opposed to Graphics' 24x24), greater speed, and, probably, fewer bugs.

The color palette has changed as well, it is now 256 colors instead of 128,
though it uses the same system of having a limited number of hues in conjunction
with all possible levels of brightness (in retrospect, this was a terrible
mistake - I should have at least halved the number of brightness levels and gone
for twice the hues). Note that this means that sprites produced by SprEdit are
not directly compatible with those produced by Graphics (they will load but the
palette will be off).

If you want to try out the application quickly, there's a precompiled version
in the 'COMPILED' directory with all the auxiliary files (documentation etc.)
that would be present in the final installation package.

Compilation
-----------

First things first, compile all the files in the SOURCES directory so as to
obtain SPREDIT.EXE. Move this to the final output directory (usually COMPILED).

Now enter the RESOURCE directory and execute MAKEGRP.EXE while in the SPRITES
directory. This will create the files IMG.GRP and IMG.NDX which you will rename
to GRAFICA.GRP and GRAFICA.IDX respectively. Move these, along with a copy of
PAL256.ACT, to a subdirectory called GUI in the final output directory. Also
copy SPREDIT.DOC to the output directory while you're there.

The final step is to compile MAKECHK.EXE from the POSTCOMP directory and run it
in the final output directory. This should generate a SPREDIT.CHK file that the
application uses to verify the integrity of its files. Note, however, that this
check is disabled in the latest version of SprEdit, so pretty much any .CHK file
will do.

I didn't find any .BAT files in the original archive, so I assume I used to do
all these steps manually.

Usage
-----

The program includes a reasonably detailed manual and, at least as far as
basic operations are concerned, the controls are intuitive enough for one to
be able to get started quickly. Reading that manual makes me cringe now. You can
certainly tell I was 13 when I wrote it.

The interface is exclusively mouse-driven. This even includes the times when
you must specify a filename; instead of typing it in, you select the letters
one by one from an on-screen keyboard! In fact, the whole file selection
interface is rife with egregious design choices. There are no words to describe
it, just try it and see. The worst thing of all is that file and directory
navigation are somehow separated; you select a folder first (without seeing any
files), and only then SprEdit scans the folder for .SPR files and allows you
to make a choice. Crazy. What was I thinking!?

My usual habit of overengineering the wrong thing is apparent. Note how the
cursor changes to reflect the tool you are using, and even the current hue.
Even the eyedropper (represented as a magnifying glass) cursor changes so as to
show the color underneath it. I thought it was a nice touch at the time, and
still do, but in retrospect, it was definitely not the right thing to spend so
much effort on.

Technical Notes
---------------

The code sometimes seems even worse than that of Graphics. It is amazing how I
could put so much care into the outward appearance of the program yet display
such shocking ignorance of elementary programming principles.

Note that there's a variable somewhere in the called called "monicalewinski".
I shit you not. At least that confirms the 1998 timeframe for the development
of the program.

Date analysis
.............

Note the two 'phases' in development (Sep-Oct 1998 and Apr 1999) and especially
the much later edits in 2000 and 2007. I think I modified the main program in
2000 so as to disable the integrity check so that I could re-run for fun without
much hassle (I had stopped using it by then); then, in 2007, I recall playing
with the video mode settings to see whether I could get SprEdit to run in
320x240 mode.

Content analysis
................

There is something wrong with the RESURSA directory. Normally, this would
contain all of the individual .SPR files that go into making the .GRP resource
file, as well as the utilities for doing that (MAKEGRP at the least). I must
have accidentally deleted this at some point, then, seeing in horror what I
had done, I decided to just put a copy of the .GRP file in there, so that, if
necessary, I could unpack it to retrieve the original .SPR files. This is just
what I have done as part of my preservation operations.
