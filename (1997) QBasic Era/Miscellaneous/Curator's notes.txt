Various utilities of no particular importance.

COLOR.BAS (15 Feb 1998)
    A color picker program, helped me decide which colors to use from the MCGA
    standard 256-color palette.

DEMOVIZ.BAS (original date lost)
    Draws random visualisations under 4-way symmetry.

GATCODER.BAS (05 Jan 1998)
    Simple translation encoder. The code used features only the letters G,A,T,C
    (the DNA building blocks, get it?) in various colors.

GENLABIR.BAS (original date lost)
    Generates a maze by depth-first recursion.

LABIRINT.BAS (13 Jul 1997)
    Generates a pseudo-maze (i.e. solvability not guaranteed) by filling the
    screen with random slashes.
