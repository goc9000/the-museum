Minesweeper
===========

Timeline
--------

Original date is unknown, but at least the year 2000, near or after the time
LuptTrek was made.

Description
-----------

A Minesweeper clone I made in an afternoon when I was bored. Note that I
remember making this long after I had left QBasic behind - it was made more as
a self-dare, to see whether I could quickly implement this classic in a language
I had fond memories of. As a result, the game is as bare-bones as it can get -
it won't even react if you step on a mine!

Note the crazy controls: 6,7,8,9 and 0 for left, right, down, up and 'click'
respectively. Long, hard years of playing ZX Spectrum games without an actual
Sinclair joystick have made me one of the few people on the planet to whom those
controls come naturally. 

Technical notes
---------------

The code is somewhat sloppy, but clearly one class above everything else I had
done in QBasic up to that point. It could have been even cleaner had I cared.

Note the use of "J = STICK(1)". I'm not sure whether this generalizes to other
systems, but on my PC, this caused a predictable delay of around 100ms or so
(probably due to scanning for a non-existent joystick), so I used it for slowing
down the main game loop enough for the cursor to blink visibly.
