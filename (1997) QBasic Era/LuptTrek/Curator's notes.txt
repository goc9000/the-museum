Timeline
--------

As the title screen states, 10 Jun 2000.

Description
-----------

A Trek-themed 2D dogfight game. Pretty rubbish.

Technical notes
---------------

Note that my programming skills had improved significantly by now. There is a
decent attempt at modularization, and the advanced subroutine facilities of
QBasic are beginning to be employed.
