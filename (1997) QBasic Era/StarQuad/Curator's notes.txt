Description
-----------

A quirky space-themed shoot'em-up. You have to kill all enemies while avoiding
the torpedoes they throw at you. You can use Q/A (up/down) and Y/U (left/right)
to move, Space to fire your lasers, T to fire a torpedo, and Z/X to drop
attractor or repeller probes. If you get too damaged, systems will start to
fail, so you have to get away from the enemies so that a base will appear and
fix you up.

Some inspiration seems to have been drawn from Star Raiders II and the Star
Trek game on the Atari 2600 (or a clone thereof).

Technical notes
---------------

The code is horrible. Note, though, that I took the trouble of writing a routine
for drawing a small font using vector graphics for use in the help screen. Talk
about focusing on the wrong thing!
