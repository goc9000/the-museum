Slalom

Description
-----------

A very simple game, just steer the guy between the flags while avoiding the
incoming trees. Use the [ ] keys to steer, { } to steer harder, and Q to jump.
It doesn't seem to me like the jump can actually get you past a tree; I probably
intended to add some jumpable hazards like logs or puddles later.

Technical notes
---------------

I think this was one of my first games that featured blitting using GET and PUT.
