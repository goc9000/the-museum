Description
-----------

ReadPort is a utility for studying the IBM PC port system. It allows one to
navigate through the port array and graphically monitor the ports as they change
value in response to system events.

The application is surprisingly sophisticated and polished given its purpose. It
even features a 'scanning' mode that looks at each port and determines its
nature (spontaneously variable, fixed value, probably disconnected etc.), as
well as a 'tape recorder' mode. The latter is not mentioned in the help screen;
to access it press 'R' and then you can control the recording using the
following keys:

+ - start recording
Space - stop recording
Enter - play
< - rewind
> - fast forward
R - back to normal mode

There is also a 'safe' mode that allows for higher precision measurements. To
access this press shift+S and then follow the on-screen instructions.

Technical notes
---------------

As usual, the code is pretty bad. Ridiculous use of subroutines, multiple
violations of the DRY principle, etc. More unfortunate is the fact that, for all
that outer polish, ReadPort did not really turn out to be as useful as I had
hoped. Doing a serious study of the port system requires that you know quite a
bit more about its structure and implementation than I did at the time.
