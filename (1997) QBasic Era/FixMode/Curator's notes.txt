FixMode

Timeline
--------

Original date has been lost; Probably closer to 2000 than to 1997.

Description
-----------

A simple logic puzzle. You get a grid of squares, each of which can be in one
of three states: red, yellow or green. 'Clicking' on a square will cause it to
change state, as well as trigger two other squares, not necessarily distinct.
Your goal is to turn all squares green.

The reason why this is called 'FixMode' is that this was supposed to be a mockup
for a minigame in a much larger game I had planned, 'SuperMeow in Space'. The
action would have taken place on a spaceship, and in between mowing down waves
of baddies, you would have had to occasionally poke around with a high-tech
screwdriver in panels to get some doors open. Most of these puzzle sequences
would have consisted of this very problem, though hidden behind much better
graphics. In the end, the larger project was abandoned, but this puzzle did get
to be incorporated in the bomb defusing sequence in Arachno Joe II, a ZX
Spectrum game I made for a competition.

Technical notes
---------------

Pretty decent effort for what was to be a throwaway program. Note that I was
careful enough to ensure that you are always given puzzles that allow for a
solution.
