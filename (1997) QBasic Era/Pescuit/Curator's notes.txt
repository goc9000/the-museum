Description
-----------

This is a type-in from a magazine, featuring some heavy modifications from me
with respect to the user interaction bits.  The original type-in had a
terminal-like interface, and I decided to jazz it up a bit by providing a
constantly updated status display, single keypress commands and so on.

As for the game itself, it's supposed to be a fishing simulator and it's boring
as hell. I kept it mostly for historical reasons.

Technical notes
---------------

Note the use of the J=STICK(1) trick.
