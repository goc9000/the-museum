Description

This is an implementation of the well-known Towers of Hanoi puzzle game, with
adjustable disk count and even a mode where the computer can (try to) solve the
puzzle from its current position.

Technical Notes
---------------

Solving the Hanoi puzzle from the *initial* configuration is, of course, a
well-known recursion exercise. More interesting is the idea of solving it from
an *arbitrary* configuration. What the algorithm in this program tries to do is
to perform one or two moves so as to obtain one of the configurations on the
"normal track" generated by the recursive algorithm, after which it can just
continue on that track to the end. It does not always work, of course, but it
still covers a surprisingly wide array of situations.

I remember this was one of the moments where I actually started to think more
seriously about algorithms in my programs. Despite the glaring imperfections in
my solver, I was still damn proud of it at the time.
