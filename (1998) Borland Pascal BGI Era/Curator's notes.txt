General Notes About the Borland Pascal BGI Era
==============================================

This era includes all programs made using the standard graphics facilities in
Borland Pascal, i.e. the BGI (Borland Graphics Interface). The BGI was friendly
and portable, but awfully slow, so I generally only used it for puzzle games or
when I really could not do without the higher resolutions modes.

The chronological relationship between this and the XVGA era is not simple. In
fact, it seems to me they were hopelessly intertwined, with me first starting
with BGI, then being quickly lured to the amazing speed of the XVGA facilities,
then going back to doing some BGI programs as a challenge to myself.

Note that BGI programs generally needed to include some object files such as
fonts and at least one driver. These have been encapsulated in the units
BGIDRIV.TPU and BGIFONT.TPU. I have also included the sources for these in the
folder COMMON.LIB.
