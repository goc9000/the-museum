Description
-----------

This is a simple implementation of the well-known '14-15 puzzle'. Play is pretty
straightforward, you choose the difficulty (which is a measure of how much
shuffling there will be at first), and then try to arrange the pieces into their
original configuration. Note that only solvable puzzles are generated - in fact,
you can see that the program does the shuffling much like a human would.

Note that the credits claim that the puzzle was invented by Sam Lloyd. This is
now believed to be false, instead Wikipedia mentions a Noyes Palmer Chapman as
the true inventor.

Technical Notes
---------------

The programming is not great, but you can see that I've made some progress in
terms of making my code cleaner and more modular. Or maybe it's just that the
program itself is simpler and there is less opportunity for spaghettizing things
up.

Note that some of my XVGA "knowledge" has crept in: I change the palette and do
v-syncing.

If you look closely, there is some material left over from Reversi.
