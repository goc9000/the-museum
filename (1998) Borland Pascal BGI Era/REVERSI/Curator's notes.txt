Description
-----------

This is an implementation of Reversi (also known as Othello). You can play
either against the computer or a human player, and, as a bonus, you can also
get the computer to play itself.

Technical Notes
---------------

I seem to remember heavy inspiration was drawn from a ZX Spectrum type-in, which
might explain the bizarre GOSUB comments that show up in the algorithm unit.
The algorithm is of the simple 1-ply positional kind: the value of a move is
evaluated by counting the pieces of either side and weighing them in accordance
to their position on the board: pieces in the corner, for instance, are given
the greatest weight because they can never be retaken; pieces one square away
from the egde, however, have poor value because they invite the enemy to retake
them and thus gain a valuable position on the edge or even in the corner of the
board. It makes for a pretty decent opponent against a beginner, I think.
