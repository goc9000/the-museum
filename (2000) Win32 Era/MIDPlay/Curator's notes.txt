MIDPlay
=======

Timeline
--------

File dates suggest the program was developed from August to September 2000.

Description
-----------

MIDPlay is a simple Winamp-like program for MIDI music (.MID and .RMI files).
I remember making it mainly because all of the other MIDI players I had simply
took up too much space on the screen.

The interface is made to resemble a real-life stereo with LCD display. I still
think it looks pretty neat. Some nice touches are the fact that the window is
non-rectangular, and that the loudspeakers animate while playing.

The program text, minimal as it is, is in Romanian. For an English version,
check out MIDENG.EXE.

Note that there is a more advanced MIDPlay version, written in Delphi, that
takes the concept further, even allowing for things such as player skins (!).

Technical Notes
---------------

The code is rubbish as usual. Note the appearance of the 'non-rectangular
window region' trick. I would revisit this fascinating gimmick many times in
the future.
