General Notes About the Win32 Era
=================================

This era marks the beginning of my transition to Windows-based programming.
Although most such work was done in Delphi and other RAD environments, I did
initially experiment with old-style programming using the Win32 API and the
Borland Pascal for Windows custom control system. As is typical, I began by
tinkering with the Borland demos (Swat!, Paint etc.) and gradually learned how
to create my own Windows games and utilities.

Note that even as early as Borland Pascal, Windows programming was also an
opportunity to get acquainted with OOP - you had classes like TWindow, etc.
which provided convenient wrappers around the complex Win32 API. Unfortunately,
I remember quite distinctly that I did not truly understand OOP at that time.
As is quite evident in the code, I use it in a 'cargo cult' fashion, going
through the motions in order to get my program running but without any real
understanding as to its power and benefits. True mastery of OOP would come
much, much later for me.
