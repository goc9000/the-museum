V.E.C.H. v2.0
=============
(Vizualizator/Editor/Comparator Hexazecimal - "Hex Viewer/Editor/Comparer")

Timeline
--------

File dates suggest the program was developed during September 2000.

Description
-----------

V.E.C.H., as the name suggests, is a hex editor with a realtime side-by-side
compare function. It has only a minimal set of features and suffers from the
crippling limitation in that, like Notepad, it can only handle files up to
64K in size. I seem to remember I mostly used it with ZX Spectrum emulator
snapshots (.SNA files), so that was not a problem for me.

Technical Notes
---------------

The code is awful as always. The worst part remains the design, though -
only 64K and not even a character display to go with the hex screens? What
was I thinking?
