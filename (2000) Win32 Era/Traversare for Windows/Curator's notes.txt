Traversare for Windows
======================

Timeline
--------

File dates suggest the program was developed from August to December 2000.

Description
-----------

What is it with me and Frogger clones? I guess if it's worth doing once, it's
worth doing it again, and again, and again...

Of all my Frogger clones, this is probably the most polished. It features
semi-isometric graphics, MIDI music and sound effects (yes, the sound effects
are MIDI as well!) and even a sort of 'night mode' where the hazards are
harder to see and you have to guess their size by their headlights. My original
plan was to make many other kinds of levels (evening, fog, thunderstorm etc.)
but eventually I moved on to other projects.

The game is in Romanian, but features help files in both English and Romanian.

Technical Notes
---------------

The code is pretty bad. Notably, there is no real use of OOP, as would be
expected for a Windows application in this era. Nevertheless, there are some
subtle signs of progress. I'm beginning to use the 'case' construct
appropriately, and, except for a few instances, the code is decently split up
into functions and procedures. I also used a neat trick for storing and
displaying the many sprites for the hazards in this game: instead of having
hundreds of individual bitmaps (and thus variables, as I hadn't mastered
arrays of objects, apparently), they are all stored in a single image. When a
hazard (car, crocodile etc.) is to be displayed, the coordinates of that
particular sprite within the bitmap are computed, and only that area is
blitted to screen. This is somewhat similar to the mechanism used internally
in Delphi's ImageLists, or modern-day CSS sprites.
