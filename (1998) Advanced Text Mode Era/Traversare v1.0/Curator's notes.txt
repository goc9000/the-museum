Traversare v1.0
===============

Timeline
--------

This one's a bit tricky. There is only one .PAS file and it's dated Nov 2004,
but the font file is from May 2001. Given the fact that a Borland C version of
this program was created in December 2004, featuring a clearly improved code
style, it's far more likely that this version was developed around May 2001.
The later date on the .PAS file is the result of me tweaking the program so
that it would run again on my system before I could draw inspiration for it
when designing the C version.

Description
-----------

Another Frogger clone intended as a homage to a ZX Spectrum type-in. This time,
the similarities to the Spectrum version are even stronger, as this program
also uses UDGs and character-level coloring.

The interface is in Romanian, but I doubt that will pose a problem to playing
such a well-known game.

Technical Notes
---------------

The CRT unit in Borland Pascal had a notorious bug that caused the delay()
function to stop working in high-end systems. The game tries to work around
this by providing its own delay routine with an RTC-based calibration run at
the start of the program. This also allows for the sub-millisecond delays used
in the game's Atari-like sound effects. Unfortunately, the routine is not very
well designed and doesn't work properly in DosBox. There is no way to fix this
without making extensive changes to the program, so I have provided a manually
patched executable that should work okay under DosBox provided you run it with
the 'cycles' parameter fixed at 30000.
