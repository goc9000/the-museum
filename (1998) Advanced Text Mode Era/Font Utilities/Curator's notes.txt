Description
-----------

This is a suite of three simple utilities for working with VGA text mode fonts:

VIZFNT14: View 8x14 font
VIZFNT16: View 8x16 font
SCHIMBFN: Change font persistently

The font viewing utilities display a full ASCII table and the full text of a
(lame) joke. The attached screenshot shows the output for the FM Tracker font;
you can see the UDGs for instrument icons and drum track indicators.
