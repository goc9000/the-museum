General Notes About the Advanced Text Mode Era
==============================================

This period runs parallel to my Borland Pascal BGI and XVGA explorations. The
programs grouped herein are distinguished by their use of text mode, custom
fonts and user defined graphics. Although by this time I was able to program a
proper graphical interface, many of the programs here were made this way due to
my desire to challenge myself by pushing retro techniques to their limits (and
also as a homage to the ZX Spectrum, which had returned to my full attention
during this period).
