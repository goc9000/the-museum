Font Editor
===========

Timeline
--------

The file dates suggest development occured mostly around June 1999. Although
there are many files dating from December 2000, it is likely that this was me
coming back to the program and trying to optimize it and get it to a fully
completed state. The core font files, however, date from Jun 1999, and the
program had to have been in a usable state by Sep 1999, when the font for FM
Tracker was created.

Description
-----------

This is an editor for VGA text mode fonts (size 8x16 to be precise). Since
most of my text mode programs featured custom fonts, it was obviously quite an
important utility to have around.

The interface is in Romanian (it even features diacritics!). I guess I must
have been going through a phase where I thought that since I would be the only
person using these programs, why not use my native language as a challenge...
There aren't that many commands in the program though, so anyone should be able
to get around the program easily after checking out a few words in a
dictionary.

Emulation remarks
-----------------

Unfortunately, due to limitations in VGA font emulation in Dosbox 0.74, the
second display from left to right, which is supposed to show you the complete
font you are editing, will always show the "default", unmodified system font.
You can view .FNT files in full using the utilities from the Font Operations
suite.

Technical Notes
---------------

Typically rubbish code with excessive emphasis on presentation as opposed to
functionality. At least this time I bothered to code a proper file selection
dialog. One other interesting fact is that I had begun to harness the power
of embedding files as program constants.
