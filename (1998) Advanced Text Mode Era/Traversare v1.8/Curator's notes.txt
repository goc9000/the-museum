Traversare v1.8
===============

Timeline
--------

Development occured mostly during December 2004.

Description
-----------

This is a rewritten and improved version of Traversare v1.0 that I submitted as
a final project for my Introduction to Informatics (i.e. programming) course.
It is written in Borland C (as opposed to Borland Pascal) and features slightly
better graphics and gameplay, but no sound.

Compiling
---------

All you need to do is open up the Borland C++ IDE, create a project and add all
the .C sources, then issue the Build All command. You can probably also use the
BCC program from the command line.

Usage
-----

The gameplay is straightforward - avoid the cars and make your way towards one
of the four openings in the top (where the frogs supposedly live). Once all
four openings have been filled, you pass to the next level. Starting from
level 4 onwards, you also have to collect a key before you can access any of
the openings.

From time to time, a fly will appear in a random location. Catch it before it
disappears and you can get a bonus. You also get a bonus for daring maneuvers
like jumping away right before a car hits you.

You can press P to pause the game. In the menu screen, you can also press N to
select the starting level (it's displayed in the status bar) and C to switch
to a nicer color palette. If you're wondering why the program doesn't just
select the palette automatically, it's because I wasn't entirely sure that it
would work properly under the Windows machines we had in the computer lab.

Technical Notes
---------------

Wow! What a welcome change from the typical mind-bogglingly awful code that
was typical of my early years. This time the code is clean, organized, and
logical. There are still some minor flaws, but at least it's not cringeworthy.
I'm not sure if this change was due to my college training, or if I had already
started being more self-conscious about my style even before I started college.
